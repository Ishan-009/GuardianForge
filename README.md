# GuardianForge

GuardianForge is a robust Node.js application showcasing best practices in CRUD operations, authentication, middleware, and authorization. It serves as a comprehensive foundation for user management in your projects.

**Important Note:** Initially, this project was intended for practice but evolved into a full-fledged project. As a result, I had to shift to a new repository for further development. If you want to refer to the original commits and detailed history, please visit the following link :- https://github.com/Ishan-009/Harkirat-MERN-Cohort/tree/main/Week3/Nodejs/app1 , where this project was initially developed. Commits specific to this forked repository may not capture the complete project history.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Utilize a MongoDB database to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user data. ✅

- **Middleware and Authorization:** Leverage middleware to secure routes and ensure proper authentication. Introduce role-based authorization for controlling access to specific routes. ✅
- **Granular Permissions:** Define and manage user roles to grant precise permissions, going beyond simple "admin" roles.
- **User Management API:** Efficiently manage users through well-defined APIs, including role assignments and secure password updates.
- **Input Sanitization:** Protect against injection attacks with robust input sanitization practices.
- **Rate Limiting:** Enhance security with rate limiting mechanisms to prevent potential abuse.
- **Testing, Logging, Documentation:** Follow industry best practices in testing, logging, and documentation for reliability, traceability, and maintainability.
